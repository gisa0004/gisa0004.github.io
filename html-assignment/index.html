        <h2>about me</h2>
            <p> My names are kelly Gisa im a Rwandan male born and raised in Rwanda. I'm a big music fan, this includes generes like afro,dancehall,and 2000's r&b hip hop music. also im a big photography and videography fan. this is also why i joined the <abbr title="interactive media and design">imd</abbr> class</p>
            <p1>I arrived in Canada in December of 2022 i was in a University in a small town called kamloops and i was doing Geography and found it was not my field and i decided to come to algonquin college to do what i wanted to do. The reason to why i chose the <abbr title="interactive media design">imd</abbr> class is because it has more than photography and videography and i wanted to be a <em>jack of all trades</em></p1>
