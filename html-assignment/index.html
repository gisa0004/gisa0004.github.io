        <h2>about me</h2>
            <p> My names are kelly Gisa I'm a Rwandan male born and raised in Rwanda. I'm a big music fan, this includes generes like afro,dancehall,and 2000's r&b hip hop music.I'm also a big photography and videography fan. This is also why I joined the <abbr title="Interactive Media and Design">IMD</abbr> class. I hope by the end of the 2 years ill have the adequate skills needed for my career as a media creator. </p>
            <p1>I arrived in Canada in December of 2022 i was in a University in a small town called kamloops and I was doing Geography and found it was not my field and I decided to come to algonquin college to do what I wanted to do. The reason to why I chose the <abbr title="Interactive Media Design">IMD</abbr> class is because it has more than photography and videography and I wanted to also be a <em>jack of all trades.</em> I know that this journey won't be easy all I have to do is to push:<br><em><strong>P</strong><em>ersist.<br><strong>U</strong>ntil.<br><strong>S</strong>omething.<br><strong>H</strong>appens.</em>
